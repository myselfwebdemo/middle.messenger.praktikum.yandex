# Middle Messenger (Sprint 2)

## What's New?

— Implemented TypeScript.  
— Added component approach to the project:
    • (+) Block & Event Bus implementation
    • (+) ```block```

The project is a starter layout for a messenger-style web application.
It includes several static pages and Handlebars templates, uses TypeScript modules for better code structure, and PostCSS with Autoprefixer / CSSNano for optimized and consistent styling. The build is configured with Vite for fast development and bundling.

## Fast Deploy

```bash
npm install        # build dependencies
npm run start      # start dev-server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # build project in dist/
npm run preview    # start local preview of the build
```
